About the Task:
The goal was to perform Iris Flower Classification using machine learning techniques. I trained models on iris flowers' measurements to accurately predict their species. The data included features like Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width. I experimented with three machine learning algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and KNN.
